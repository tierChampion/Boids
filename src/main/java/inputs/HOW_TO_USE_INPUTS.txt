Listeners are the things responsible for managing inputs.
In this case, GLFW offers support for a mouse, a keyboard or a controller, and you initialize them
by using the methods

glfwSet___Callback(glfwWindow, Class::methodForCallback).

For the mouse and the keyboard, actions are called callbacks and are automatically called
when said action happens.
For the controller, it has callback only for the connection of the controller and the rest is stored in
buffers for the buttons and the axes.
For callbacks (actions) examples, go to https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/input_guide.html
