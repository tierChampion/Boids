Rendering with OpenGL is pretty complicated but is simplified by subdividing the process.
First, you need a shader program and before rendering, you must load the values to the different uniform variables.
Right after, you then bind the Vao as well your Vertex attributes, in this case, positions, texture coordinates and
vertex normals.

Then, you render with glDrawElements and the shader program will be applied to the Vao.
After rendering, you unbind the Vao and Vertex attributes to prepare to render the next model.
