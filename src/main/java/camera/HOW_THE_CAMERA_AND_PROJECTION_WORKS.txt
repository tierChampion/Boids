The Camera and the Projection are some of the most important things to understand in 3d graphics.
They are all applied as matrices, which are mathematical tools that can modify vectors in many different ways when
multiplied with them. They are mainly used to change from a space to another.

Every model starts as an OBJ file, where the center of the universe is most likely the center of the model. This is
called Model Space. Then, with properties like it's orientation and it's position, you construct a Model Matrix,
which when applied, changes the model from Model Space to World Space. This means that center of the universe is now
the world space (0, 0, 0). You then apply the View Matrix, which is obtained with the camera position and orientation,
which changes the space to the View Space. In 3d rendering, the camera is completely fictional and the View Matrix
applied actually shifts the center of the universe to the position of the camera, which means that what actually
happens is that the world is shifted in the opposite direction of the camera position. After the View Space, the world
is positioned just how the camera would see the world and so the final matrix is applied, the Projection Matrix,
which places the space in Screen Space. The screen space has the coordinate system used by OpenGL to render stuff.
The x and y coordinates that are between -1 and 1 will be rendered to the screen and the two other coordinates have
special uses. The z coordinate is used for z-Buffering, which solves the problem of rendering things on top of each
other and the w coordinate has the original value of the z coordinate and is used in the case of a perspective
projection to scale down far away objects.
