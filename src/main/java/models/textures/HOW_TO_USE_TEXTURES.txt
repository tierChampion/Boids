Textures are .png files that are used to color a 3d model.
Models have texture coordinates, which maps each 3d point to a 2d point on a texture.
This allows to kind of wrap a texture on a 3d model.

To load a texture to OpenGL, you first generate it and bind it, and then by using the different
OpenGL texture parameter methods, you can assign different properties to the textures like how it fills
space or things like mipmapping and anisotropic filtering, which are ways to fix to problem of far away textures.

To then use them in shaders, they are considered sampler2D in GLSL and you load them like any other uniform variable.
