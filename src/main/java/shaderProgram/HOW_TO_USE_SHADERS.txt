Shaders are the programs used for coloring and other visual effects.
They are effectively the way to communicate with the GPU be it to draw or make complex calculation faster.

There exist many types of shaders: Vertex (MANDATORY, where you convert the position in the world to screen coordinates),
Fragment (MANDATORY, where you deal with the color of an object), Geometry (where you play with the geometry of shapes,
you can change where they are or even add new shapes) and Compute (an all-purpose shader where you can make a lot of
calculation fast, since it enables you to use many threads to make operations in parallel)

For any shader, you first assign a pointer and place the source code in that pointer. You then compile it and it
is ready for use.
You then add all your shaders to one shader program, which puts all these shaders back-to-back, ready for rendering.
Before rendering, you bind the shader program you want to use, and it will be used in that rendering.
After that rendering, you then have to unbind it to maybe use another shader program.
